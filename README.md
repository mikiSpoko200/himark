# Oh, hi `mark`.

For those who crave more ergonomic marker traits.

## About

Marker traits are a common design pattern in Rust, however they tend to be very tidious in actual usage and generate boilerplate. 

This crate helps address both of these difficulties by providing simple to understand expansions:
- generating impls for marker traits with `himark::mark`
- validating if trait meets the criteria of being a marker trait with `himark::marker`
